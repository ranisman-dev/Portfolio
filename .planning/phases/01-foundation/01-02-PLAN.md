<objective>
Create all HTML placeholder pages at correct URL paths and define the single-source nav and footer markup in `_includes/`.

Purpose: Every subsequent phase writes content into pages that already exist at the right URL. The work index at `/work/` is locked now, before any project sub-pages are ever created. The nav and footer are defined once in `_includes/` so editing them once updates all pages.

Output: Five HTML skeleton pages (Home, Work, Writing, About, Earlier Work), plus `_includes/nav.html` and `_includes/footer.html`.

  <action>
    Create five HTML pages using the base template pattern below. The working directory is C:/Users/rebec/Documents/Portfolio (repo root).

    Platform is Netlify (private GitHub repo auto-deploys to Netlify). Do NOT create a .nojekyll file — Netlify does not use Jekyll, so it is not needed.

    CRITICAL: Do NOT touch the CNAME file. It is infrastructure — any modification resets the custom domain and HTTPS provisioning. Treat as read-only.

    All files use root-relative paths for CSS and JS (e.g., /css/tokens.css, not ../css/tokens.css). Root-relative paths work from any directory depth. Relative paths break on sub-pages.

    All filenames and directories are already lowercase with hyphens (established in Plan 01-01). Do not introduce any uppercase or camelCase.

    **Base template — use for every page, changing only the `<title>`, `<meta description>`, `<body>` class, and `<main>` content:**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>PAGE NAME — Origami Games</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Page-specific description placeholder.">

        <div class="container">
          <h1>PAGE NAME</h1>
          <p>Placeholder — content added in Phase 2+.</p>
        </div>
      </main>

      <!-- Footer injected here by js/nav.js — do not put footer markup here directly -->
      <div id="site-footer"></div>

      <!-- GSAP: use defer (NOT async) to preserve execution order -->

    **File-specific values:**

    **index.html** (Home — repo root):
    - `<title>`: `Origami Games — Narrative & Experience Engineer`
    - `<meta description>`: `Origami Games — game systems designed to help players reflect on well-being, pressure, and meaning.`
    - `<body class>`: `page-home`
    - `<h1>`: `Origami Games`
    - Placeholder paragraph: `Narrative & Experience Engineer — portfolio coming together.`

    **work/index.html** (Work index — REQ-F07: this URL must be locked before any project sub-pages):
    - `<title>`: `Work — Origami Games`
    - `<meta description>`: `Game design and narrative projects by Origami Games.`
    - `<body class>`: `page-work`
    - `<h1>`: `Work`
    - Placeholder paragraph: `Project case studies — content added in Phase 3.`

    **writing/index.html** (Writing index):
    - `<title>`: `Writing — Origami Games`
    - `<meta description>`: `Writing samples and narrative documents by Origami Games.`
    - `<body class>`: `page-writing`
    - `<h1>`: `Writing`
    - Placeholder paragraph: `Writing samples — content added in Phase 5.`

    **about/index.html** (About + contact anchor):
    - `<title>`: `About — Origami Games`
    - `<meta description>`: `About the designer behind Origami Games.`
    - `<body class>`: `page-about`
    - `<h1>`: `About`
    - Add an anchor section for the contact destination:
      ```html
      <section id="contact">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>Placeholder — contact details added in Phase 7.</p>
      </section>
      ```
    - The Contact nav link (`/about#contact`) must resolve to this section.

    **earlier-work/index.html** (Earlier work stub — hidden from nav until Phase 6):
    - `<title>`: `Earlier Work — Origami Games`
    - `<meta description>`: `Earlier projects and retrospectives by Origami Games.`
    - `<body class>`: `page-earlier-work`
    - `<h1>`: `Earlier Work`
    - Placeholder paragraph: `Retrospectives and earlier projects — content added in Phase 6.`
    - Add an HTML comment at the top of `<main>`: `<!-- This page is intentionally hidden from primary nav until Phase 6 -->`

    <manual>All five files exist. index.html title contains "Origami Games". work/index.html body class is "page-work". about/index.html has id="contact" anchor section. earlier-work/index.html exists but is not linked anywhere yet.</manual>
  </verify>
  <done>Five HTML pages exist at their correct paths. Every page uses root-relative CSS/JS paths, the base template structure, and a page-specific body class. about/index.html has the #contact anchor section. No page links to earlier-work/index.html from the nav (that happens in Plan 02 task 2 — the nav.html will omit it).</done>

  <name>Task 2: Create _includes/nav.html and _includes/footer.html</name>
  <files>
    _includes/nav.html
    _includes/footer.html
  </files>
  <action>
    Create two HTML fragment files in the _includes/ directory. These are injected at runtime by js/nav.js (created in Plan 03). They are NOT full HTML documents — just the markup for the nav and footer elements.

    Platform is Netlify. The _includes/ directory starts with an underscore. Jekyll would exclude this directory from processing, but Netlify does not use Jekyll, so _includes/ is served normally. Fetch requests to /_includes/nav.html will resolve correctly.

    **_includes/nav.html:**

    ```html
    <!-- _includes/nav.html -->
    <!-- Single source of truth for site navigation -->
    <!-- Injected into every page via js/nav.js — do not duplicate this markup in page files -->
    <!-- To add a nav link: edit this file once; all pages update on next load -->
    <nav class="site-nav" aria-label="Main navigation">
      <a href="/" class="site-nav__logo">Origami Games</a>
      <ul class="site-nav__list" role="list">
        <li><a href="/" class="site-nav__link">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/work/" class="site-nav__link">Work</a></li>
        <li><a href="/writing/" class="site-nav__link">Writing</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about/" class="site-nav__link">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about#contact" class="site-nav__link">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    ```

    IMPORTANT: /earlier-work/ must NOT appear in this nav. It is hidden from primary nav until Phase 6. The page file exists; the nav does not link to it.

    Nav label requirements (REQ-N01 — all labels self-evident on first read):
    - "Home", "Work", "Writing", "About", "Contact" — plain English, no jargon
    - "Contact" links to /about#contact — it is an anchor link, not a separate page

    **_includes/footer.html:**

    ```html
    <!-- _includes/footer.html -->
    <!-- Single source of truth for site footer -->
    <!-- Injected into every page via js/nav.js -->
    <!-- REQ-N03: nav echo + contact email + LinkedIn + resume PDF -->
    <!-- To update footer links: edit this file once; all pages update on next load -->
    <footer class="site-footer">
      <nav class="site-footer__nav" aria-label="Footer navigation">
        <a href="/">Home</a>
        <a href="/work/">Work</a>
        <a href="/writing/">Writing</a>
        <a href="/about/">About</a>
        <a href="/about#contact">Contact</a>
      </nav>
      <div class="site-footer__contact">
        <a href="mailto:hello@rebeccaanisman.com">hello@rebeccaanisman.com</a>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccaanisman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
        <a href="/assets/pdfs/resume.pdf" download>Resume PDF</a>
      </div>
      <p class="site-footer__credit">Origami Games &copy; 2026</p>
    </footer>
    ```

    NOTE on email and LinkedIn: Use `hello@rebeccaanisman.com` as the email placeholder (derived from the domain in CNAME: rebeccaanisman.com). Use `https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccaanisman/` as the LinkedIn URL placeholder. Both are easily updated in one place (this file) when the user confirms the real values. The resume PDF at /assets/pdfs/resume.pdf does not exist yet — it will be added in Phase 7. The link is correct; the file will be placed there later.

    NOTE on /earlier-work/: Do NOT add an Earlier Work link to the footer nav. It matches the nav behavior — hidden until Phase 6.

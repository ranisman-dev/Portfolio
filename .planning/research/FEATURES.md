# Features Research: Game Design Portfolio

**Research date:** 2026-02-23
**Project:** Origami Games — Narrative and Experience Engineer portfolio
**Research method:** Synthesis from game industry knowledge, hiring manager discourse, and narrative design community best practices (through August 2025 knowledge cutoff). Live web search was unavailable in this environment; findings reflect well-established industry consensus.

## Table Stakes
*Features every game design portfolio must have or visitors leave.*

### 1. Immediate Identity Statement
**What:** A headline or above-the-fold statement that answers "who is this person and what do they design?" within 5 seconds.
**Why it's required:** Hiring managers and studio leads skim dozens of portfolios. If specialization is not clear immediately, they move on. Generic "game designer" framing is disqualifying at mid-to-senior level.
**Game-specific nuance:** Narrative/experience designers must distinguish themselves from systems designers, level designers, and UX designers — the field conflates these. The identity statement must do that work.
**Complexity:** Low. One heading, one sentence. The hard part is the writing, not the implementation.

---

### 2. Case Studies with Process Visibility
**What:** At least 2–3 project write-ups that show the design *process*, not just the outcome. Must include: the problem, constraints, decisions made, and what was learned.
**Why it's required:** The universal feedback from hiring managers across studios (indie, AA, AAA) is that they care more about how you think than what shipped. Screenshots and trailers alone are a red flag — they suggest the designer can't articulate their process.
**Game-specific nuance:** For narrative/experience design, case studies must show the *why* behind structural and emotional decisions — not just "I wrote this quest" but "here's the player experience goal, the constraint, the approach, and what I'd do differently."
**Complexity:** High. Content-heavy. Each case study requires time to write well. This is the highest-leverage item in the portfolio.
**Dependency:** Requires a project page template/structure before content can be added (see Feature Dependencies).

---

### 3. Playable or Viewable Work
**What:** At least one artifact the visitor can directly experience — a playable prototype, an itch.io link, an embedded video walkthrough, or a recorded playthrough with designer commentary.
**Why it's required:** For game design specifically, "show don't tell" is non-negotiable. A portfolio with zero playable or viewable artifacts is purely theoretical.
**Game-specific nuance:** For shipped games, a store page link (Steam, itch.io) is acceptable. For student/jam work, embedded video or an itch.io build is expected. For narrative design, a doc excerpt or branching dialogue snippet is an acceptable substitute when a build isn't possible.
**Complexity:** Low-medium. Embedding video is low. Hosting a playable build adds complexity (itch.io handles this well externally).
**Dependency:** Requires projects to exist before they can be linked or embedded.

---

### 4. Contact / Reach-Out Pathway
**What:** A clear, low-friction way to contact the designer — ideally a contact form or a direct, visible email address. LinkedIn link.
**Why it's required:** If a hiring manager or collaborator is interested and can't find a way to reach out in under 10 seconds, the lead dies. This is the most common table-stakes failure in junior portfolios.
**Complexity:** Very low. Already built into Squarespace.
**Dependency:** None.

---

### 5. Navigation That Signals Site Structure
**What:** A nav that tells the visitor what's on the site within their first glance: Work, Writing, About at minimum.
**Why it's required:** Visitors have different goals. Hiring managers go to Work first. Collaborators may go to Writing or About. Clients go to About and Contact. A site with unclear navigation forces guessing and increases bounce.
**Complexity:** Very low. Squarespace handles this natively.

---

### 6. Mobile Responsiveness
**What:** The site must render correctly on mobile and tablet.
**Why it's required:** Hiring managers increasingly review portfolios on phones, especially during events (GDC, PAX, remote-first review). Squarespace provides this by default, but custom CSS and JS injections can break it.
**Complexity:** Low — but every custom CSS injection must be mobile-tested.
**Dependency:** Depends on all custom CSS/JS work being tested on mobile.

---

### 7. Fast Load Time
**What:** Pages load in under 3 seconds on a standard connection. Images and media are appropriately compressed.
**Why it's required:** Slow sites signal technical carelessness. For a designer whose work involves player experience, a slow portfolio is an own-goal.
**Complexity:** Low — image compression is the main lever. Squarespace CDN handles baseline performance.
**Dependency:** Depends on media assets being optimized before upload.

---

### 8. A Clearly Framed "About" Page
**What:** An About page that covers: professional identity, design philosophy, what kinds of work you do, and how to contact you. A photo is expected but not required.
**Why it's required:** Clients and collaborators specifically read About pages before deciding whether to reach out. Studios use it to assess culture fit and communication style.
**Game-specific nuance:** A design philosophy statement here is particularly valuable for narrative/experience designers because the field is still defining its own vocabulary. Owning your framing is differentiating.
**Complexity:** Low (structure). Medium (writing the philosophy statement well).

---

## Differentiators
*Features that give a competitive edge specifically for a narrative/experience designer.*

### D1. Explicit Design Philosophy Statement
**What:** A written articulation of *why* you design the way you do — your values, your lens, what player experience you're trying to create. Not a mission statement, but an argument.
**Why it differentiates:** Most game design portfolios show work. Few explain the belief system behind it. For narrative/experience design — especially work focused on well-being and meaning — the philosophy IS the product. Visitors should understand your worldview before they read a case study.
**For Origami Games specifically:** The thesis that "game systems can encourage players to reflect on their well-being and how they navigate pressure and meaning" is not obvious from work samples alone. It must be stated and argued.
**Complexity:** Low (implementation). High (requires genuine clarity of thought — this is the hardest thing to write).
**Dependency:** Informs home page identity statement, About page, and framing of each case study.

---

### D2. Writing Samples as Standalone Work
**What:** A Writing section with samples that stand on their own — not just attached to projects. Can include: design documents, worldbuilding briefs, character bibles, branching dialogue excerpts, reflective essays on design.
**Why it differentiates:** Narrative designers who treat writing as a primary artifact — not just supporting documentation — signal a different level of craft. Hiring managers looking for narrative leads want to see voice, structure, and intentionality in writing itself.
**For Origami Games specifically:** This maps directly to the planned Writing section. The key differentiator is curation: not everything, but the pieces that demonstrate range and voice.
**Complexity:** Low (structure). Medium (curation decisions).
**Dependency:** Writing section structure must be in place.

---

### D3. "What I'd Change" Retrospectives on Earlier Work
**What:** A section (or integrated notes within case studies) where the designer reflects critically on past decisions — school work, jam games, shipped features — and articulates what they'd do differently and why.
**Why it differentiates:** This is rare in game design portfolios. It signals intellectual honesty, growth mindset, and the ability to self-critique — qualities studios specifically mention as hard to find. It also elegantly solves the problem of including student/early work without misrepresenting its quality.
**For Origami Games specifically:** This is the planned "Earlier Work / Retrospectives" section. Its differentiating power is real — lean into it rather than hedging.
**Complexity:** Medium (requires genuine critical reflection, not just "I'd make it prettier").
**Dependency:** Requires earlier work to be documented or described, even if no playable artifact exists.

---

### D4. Design Briefs as Speculative Work
**What:** Design documents for games that don't exist yet, or pitches for features on existing games. Shows design thinking uncoupled from what was buildable.
**Why it differentiates:** Hiring managers for narrative and systems roles frequently want to see how a designer thinks without the constraint of "but it shipped." Design briefs demonstrate vision, scope judgment, and design vocabulary.
**Complexity:** Medium (writing). Low (presentation — a well-formatted PDF or web page).
**Dependency:** Works best when framed alongside shipped work, not as a substitute for it.

---

### D5. Annotated Process Artifacts
**What:** Including actual working documents — mood boards, early dialogue trees, revision histories, playtesting notes — with annotation explaining what they show.
**Why it differentiates:** Raw process artifacts without annotation are noise. Annotated artifacts are evidence of a working designer's mind. This is the difference between showing a sketchbook and explaining what the sketches were solving.
**For Origami Games specifically:** Particularly powerful for experience design — showing how the emotional arc of a game was mapped and revised is rare and compelling.
**Complexity:** Medium. Requires curation and annotation, not just dumping files.
**Dependency:** Requires existing working documents to be retained and organized.

---

### D6. Audience-Specific Entry Points
**What:** Subtle framing or navigation that helps different audiences (studios, collaborators, clients) find what's most relevant to them — without making the site feel like three separate sites.
**Why it differentiates:** A studio hiring manager wants shipped games and process. An indie collaborator wants to understand your design voice and working style. A client wants to know what you offer and what it costs. A site that serves all three without confusing any of them requires intentional information architecture.
**Complexity:** Medium. Requires thinking about user flows, not just page content.
**Dependency:** Depends on having enough content to warrant differentiated paths.

---

### D7. Specificity of Well-Being / Reflective Design Lens
**What:** Making the thematic throughline of the work — designing for player reflection, well-being, and meaning — explicit and visible across the site, not just in one statement.
**Why it differentiates:** The game industry is increasingly interested in player wellness and ethical design, but few designers have a clear, articulated lens. A designer who can name their approach, show it across multiple projects, and connect it to current discourse (mental health in games, cozy games, meaningful play) occupies a distinct and increasingly valued position.
**Complexity:** Low (framing/language). High (requires the work itself to support the claim — can't be applied retroactively without case study content).
**Dependency:** Depends on case study content and philosophy statement both being in place.

---

### D8. Embedded or Linked Writing Within Project Pages
**What:** Project pages that link directly to — or embed — design documents, scripts, or reflective writing relevant to that project.
**Why it differentiates:** It collapses the barrier between "showing the game" and "showing the thinking." A visitor can move from a game's outcome directly into the designer's process documentation without navigating away.
**Complexity:** Low-medium. Squarespace supports embedded PDFs and document embeds with some configuration.
**Dependency:** Depends on writing samples existing and being formatted for web reading or PDF embed.

---

## Anti-Features
*Things to deliberately NOT build — common mistakes or scope traps.*

### A1. Splash Pages / Intro Animations That Block Content
**What:** Full-screen intro animations, loading screens, or "click to enter" gates before any content is visible.
**Why to avoid:** Hiring managers reviewing portfolios under time pressure will bounce immediately. Every second of animation that delays content access is a liability. GSAP animations are appropriate for *decorating* content as it loads, not *replacing* it.
**Game-specific context:** Common in student portfolios and design school graduates who've been told to show technical sophistication. It consistently frustrates studio reviewers.

---

### A2. Password-Protected Work Without a Clear Reason
**What:** Putting case studies or work samples behind a password with no explanation of why.
**Why to avoid:** A password gate with no context signals either that the work isn't ready or that the designer doesn't trust the audience. If NDA requires it, say so explicitly and offer to share on request. Otherwise, publish it.
**Exception:** Legitimate NDA-protected shipped work with a note explaining the situation is fine.

---

### A3. Trailers-Only Project Pages
**What:** Project pages that consist of only a game trailer, a title, and a list of the designer's contributions.
**Why to avoid:** Trailers show the game, not the designer. A list of contributions ("wrote dialogue," "designed quest structure") with no elaboration is functionally identical to a resume bullet — it tells the reader nothing about how the designer thinks or what problems they solved.

---

### A4. A Work-In-Progress Public Site
**What:** Launching a portfolio with placeholder text ("coming soon," empty sections, "under construction") while actively sharing the URL.
**Why to avoid:** Placeholder content poisons first impressions. It's better to launch with fewer, complete sections than many incomplete ones. A site with two excellent case studies is vastly stronger than one with five stub pages.
**For Origami Games specifically:** The planned v1 "just enough to share" scope is exactly the right instinct. Resist the urge to add sections before they have real content.

---

### A5. Exhaustive Work Archives
**What:** Including every project ever made — game jams, class exercises, prototype experiments — presented with equal weight.
**Why to avoid:** Curation IS the portfolio. A designer who cannot curate their own work is signaling a skill gap. Three excellent, well-framed case studies outperform fifteen lightly-documented projects every time.
**For Origami Games specifically:** The retrospective framing of early work is an elegant solution — it includes the work but reframes it, preserving curation discipline.

---

### A6. Generic "About Me" Pages Without Design Voice
**What:** About pages that read like a resume summary — "I am a game designer with X years of experience in Y and Z."
**Why to avoid:** About pages are an opportunity to demonstrate design communication skills. A flat, resume-style About page signals the designer doesn't recognize this. For narrative designers especially, the About page IS a writing sample.

---

### A7. Overbuilt Technical Features
**What:** Custom CMS backends, bespoke JavaScript frameworks, complex animation systems, interactive 3D elements — built to impress technically when the portfolio is for a design/narrative role.
**Why to avoid:** For a narrative/experience design portfolio, technical complexity of the portfolio itself is largely irrelevant to the audience. Time spent building portfolio infrastructure is time not spent writing better case studies. Squarespace + targeted custom CSS/JS is appropriate scope.
**Exception:** If the designer's work explicitly involves frontend/technical implementation, demonstrating it in the portfolio itself can be relevant. For narrative design, this is rarely the case.

---

### A8. Social Feed Integration
**What:** Embedding live Twitter/X, Instagram, or Bluesky feeds on the portfolio site.
**Why to avoid:** Social feeds introduce noise the designer cannot control at point of review. A hiring manager reviewing a portfolio is not in a social media context. Feeds can also become stale, broken, or embarrassing if the platform API changes.

## Notes for Roadmap
*Key insights that should inform phase planning.*

### N1. Philosophy Before Copy
Write the design philosophy statement (D1) before writing any other copy on the site. Every other piece of text — home headline, About page, case study framing — should flow from the philosophy. Reversing this order produces incoherent sites that feel generic even when the underlying work is strong.

### N2. Two Complete Case Studies Beat Five Stubs
The v1 "just enough to share" instinct is correct and well-supported by hiring manager feedback. The quality gate for launch should be: Does each published project page show process, not just outcome? A site with one exceptional case study is linkable and professional. A site with five incomplete pages is not.

### N3. The Retrospective Section Is a Genuine Differentiator — Treat It As Such
The "What I'd Change" framing for earlier work is unusual in game design portfolios and genuinely interesting to hiring managers. It should be presented with confidence, not apologetically. Frame it as "here's how I think about design growth" not "here's my old work that isn't very good."

### N4. Narrative Designer Portfolios Are Under-Differentiated
The narrative design field does not have a settled standard for what a portfolio should look like — unlike level design (maps, blockouts) or systems design (spreadsheets, tuning docs). This is both a vulnerability (no clear template to follow) and an opportunity (the designer who presents their work clearly and with a strong voice will stand out).

### N5. Audience-Routing Without Explicit Labels
The three audiences (studios, collaborators, clients) should be served through information architecture and content sequencing, not through explicit "are you a studio? click here" prompts. Explicit audience routing feels clunky on a personal portfolio. The goal is a site where each audience naturally finds what they need through good nav and clear section framing.

### N6. The About Page Is a Writing Sample
For a narrative/experience designer, the About page is evaluated as a writing artifact, not just as information delivery. It should demonstrate voice, clarity, and intentionality — the same qualities the designer brings to game writing. Treating it as a form to fill in is a missed opportunity.

### N7. Process > Polish in Case Studies
Hiring managers at indie and AA studios consistently report that they trust a case study with honest reflection on what didn't work more than one that presents only successes. A case study that says "this mechanic didn't land in playtesting and here's what we learned" is more compelling than one that presents the shipped game as a perfect outcome.

### N8. GSAP Animations: Decoration, Not Obstruction
Origami fold animations via GSAP are a strong brand expression opportunity. The anti-pattern is using animation to delay content access. The right pattern is: content loads immediately and is readable; animations *enhance* the experience for visitors who stay to explore. Test with JS disabled to ensure the site remains fully functional and readable without animations.

### N9. v1 Minimum Viable Sections
Based on the above, the minimum viable portfolio that is "linkable and professional" for a narrative/experience designer:
- Home: Identity statement + philosophy teaser + 1-2 featured project cards
- Work: 1-2 complete case studies (process-visible, with linked artifacts)
- About + Contact: Design philosophy, professional identity, contact pathway
- Optional if ready: 1 Writing sample

Sections that should NOT launch until content is ready: Writing (full section), Retrospectives, Design Briefs. These should be hidden from nav until populated.

### N10. SEO and Discoverability Are Secondary for v1
Game design portfolios are almost never discovered via search — they are shared directly. The URL goes in a job application, a Discord message, or an email. Optimize for the experience of a skeptical-but-interested reviewer reading carefully, not for search engine ranking. SEO can be addressed in a later phase.

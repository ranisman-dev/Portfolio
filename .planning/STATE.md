## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Platform changed to GitHub Pages (free) — no Squarespace hosting plan exists; user has domain registration only
- Phase 1: GSAP loaded via CDN in HTML `<head>`; no Squarespace AJAX re-init needed (standard HTTP navigation)
- Nav confirmed: Home | Work | Writing | About | Contact (Contact = anchor /about#contact; Earlier Work hidden until Phase 6)
- Design aesthetic: warm neutrals + indie internet personality (personal web / tumblr culture, not agency-polished)
- Phase 1 placeholder pages = minimal HTML skeleton (not empty); correct structure with placeholder content

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 8: GSAP 3D transforms on actual iOS Safari must be tested before finalizing mobile detection breakpoint — desktop browser resize is not sufficient
- Phase 5: PDF inline excerpt display method needs confirmation for static HTML (iframe embed vs. PDF.js vs. hosted link with excerpt text)

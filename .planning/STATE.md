**Core value:** Visitors immediately understand who she is and what she stands for — that she
designs game systems encouraging players to reflect on their well-being and how they navigate
pressure and meaning — before reading a single case study.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Template selection (Paloma primary, Hester alternative) — requires hands-on CSS test with origami fold block before committing
- Phase 1: GSAP loaded via CDN in header injection; ScrollTrigger AJAX re-init pattern must be confirmed against current Squarespace 7.1 event API before writing production code
- Phase 3: Work Portfolio slug must be `/work` and locked before any project sub-page is published — changing it later breaks all project page URLs
- Phase 7: Contact lives as a section within About for v1 (not a standalone nav item) — reduces friction, revisit after launch

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Squarespace AJAX event names (`Squarespace.afterBodyLoad` or equivalent) should be confirmed against current 7.1 platform — knowledge cutoff is August 2025, minor API changes possible
- Phase 5: PDF embed method in Squarespace 7.1 (file block vs. embed code block vs. external link) needs confirmation before Writing section is built
- Phase 8: GSAP 3D transforms on actual iOS Safari must be tested before finalizing mobile detection breakpoint — desktop browser resize is not sufficient
